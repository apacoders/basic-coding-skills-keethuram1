/**
 *
 * Requirements for class:  NewClass
 * 
 * REQUIREMENT 5:
 * 
 * There must be a static method called CallMeIf.
 * 
 * REQUIREMENT 6:
 * 
 * There must be a static method called CallMeSwitch
 * 
 * REQUIREMENT 7:
 * 
 * The static method CallMe must take an integer from one to five.
 * Return a string that contains:
 * 
 * "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", or "Unknown"
 * 
 * if the integer passed to the method is 1, then the method will return "one"
 * if the integer passed to the method is 2, then the method will return "two"
 * if the integer passed to the method is 3, then the method will return "three" 
 * if the integer passed to the method is 4, then the method will return "four" 
 * if the integer passed to the method is 5, then the method will return "five" 
 * if the integer passed is not 1,2,3,4, or 5 - then the method will return "Unknown"
 * 
 * this algorithm must be implemented using if/else statements
 * 
 * REQUIREMENT 8:
 * 
 * The static method CallMeSwitch does the same thing as REQUIREMENT 6; however, it
 * is implemented using a switch statement.
